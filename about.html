        <h3>
            Hi, Iâ€™m Charlotte. I just completed the first semester of the Multimedia Design programme at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology which so far has been a great learning experience. Most rewarding has been the ability to bridge the gap between design and coding - a field in which I am excited to further build my skill set. <br> <br>

            Through technology we can all impact and shape the world today. I believe that equitable access to information and technology creates a more just and inclusive world. I hope to someday be able to apply my skills in a context which contributes to raise awareness of environmental issues and animal rights. <br> <br>

            In my ex-life, I worked in finance and family office management, and I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the International University of Monaco. <br> <br>

            Aside from all this, I live to travel, and I am currently based between Denmark, Monaco and Bali.
            I love cooking, gardening, hitting the gym, running in nature, yoga, drinking wine, sunsets and my french bulldog, Maybe.
            <br> <br>
            Thanks for stopping by.

                    Handcoding a responsive website
                </h2>

                <h4>
                    This project was my first attempt at prototyping, coding and testing a responsive website for various viewports and devices. The tools were Adobe XD, CSS media queries and breakpoints in combination with CSS grid layouts.

                </h4>
                <br> <br>
                <em> This exercise introduced me to the design and implementation of multi-device layout patterns for responsive webdesign. I now feel quite confident coding responsive grid layouts with CSS media queries. </em>

              <h4>
                    The task was to design a website about an art style, but also to incorporate the art style into the design of the website itself. I was given the art style 'post-modernism', however, this style is incredibly broad. I therefore narrowed it down to the Memphis Movement founded in Milan in the 1980s. My first step was to research the Memphis style and then develop a moodboard to serve as a guideline and inspiration. I defined rational and emotional keywords, as well colors, typography and textures. I made sure to keep the moodboard visible throughout the whole process.

                <h4>
                    Part of the exercise was also learning about Design Principles such a Gestalt principles and different types of contrasts.
                    Inspired by the Memphis art movement, I incorporated texture contrasts, orientation contrasts and color contrasts into the design of the site, which can be seen in the graphics of the background image which I designed in Illustrator. I also applied Gestalt principles such as figure-ground (the CSS grid areas are placed on a fixed background adding dimension), closure, proximity and symmetry.

                <h4> The next step was to design a multidevice layout pattern which would work on desktops, tablets and phones. I went for the "mostly fluid" layout type:</h4>
                <em>"A multi-column
                    layout that introduces
                    larger margins on big
                    screens, relies on fluid
                    grids and images to scale
                    from large screens down to
                    small screen sizes, and
                    stacks columns vertically in

                      <h4>After building the high fidelity prototype, it was time to user-test it. <br>I chose to conduct a Five Second test of the landing page shared on <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/" target="_blank">UsabilityHub</a> and I also carried out face-to-face interviews. <br> I wanted to measure the first impression given by the landing page, as users will bounce off a site in a matter of seconds if you fail to grab their attention fast. I wanted to test what participants thought the page was about, after viewing it for just five seconds.
                    <br>
                    The test consisted of three questions with test group size of 10, of which 7 participated.

                    The questions were the following: <br> <br>

                        - What do you think the website was about? <br>
                        - What was the purpose of the website?<br>
                        - What was the most prominent element on the page?<br>
                     <br>
                    Test findings: My test results showed that it was not clear to the users that the page was about an art style. Some thought it was a commercial website selling high-end design furniture or a page about interior design. My planned changes were therefore to reiterate the design and change the background image.
